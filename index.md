I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about yesterday's adventure. I really need to get my mind on track and start working. I have a project deadline approaching and I haven't even begun thinking on what project I'll do and there I was yesterday thinking 'Hey, I am probably immune to catching feelings'. I mean seriously woman get your priorities straight right?
